##Personal Experience

For non-Chinese first-visit tourists, Tripadvisor Beijing is good enough. You may download it from app store for free.
Lonely planet is also good but boring.

You need to know dianping.com when you stay in China, a Yelp-like website. Although it is only for Chinese readers, you may use it to talk with Taxi drivers and other people who cannot understand English.

##Communication

It's easy to get an SIM card from China Mobile and China Telecom local stores, which are everywhere in the city. It's more convenient if you can do it when you arrived in Beijing airport.

Internet access is easy and cheap, while no access to Facebook and Twitter may bother you a bit.
